This species is split into 3 known subspecies and they are all under an old-age style Kingship consisting of one individual from the largest subspecie. They are still preyed upon by predators and they live on a diet consisting of invertibrates and fruit.   They are commonly known as merchants and builders who trade and borrow from other species. They have recently discovered space travel and inhabit one other planet. Their main focus of science is neuro-science and the use of electricity.</div>
        <div class="SpeciesPanel"><p>Nyphae</p> A highly developed insectoid race that inhabits almost all explored reigions of Awkgeo, they have cities complete with modes of travel placed in the more tropical climates. They are close associates and negotiators with Maffugoe kings and other species on Awkgeo and other planets, often sharing their resources or wisdom with others. They also help in preventing wars and resolving conflict, as they have declared themselves a peaceful race. It is unknown weather they are native to this planet as they are distributed widley. Their technology is highest developed in space travel, city building and communication. they channel a lot of their work using other species and have their own brand of service animals artificialy created by them, this highlights their knowlage in genetic engineering.</div>

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</div>
        <div class="SpeciesPanel"><p>lAt3r</p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</div>
